## Akeso: Bringing Post-Compromise Security to Cloud Storage

Here's the list of components that make up Akeso
- **gcsfuse** - [Link](https://github.com/etclab/gcsfuse)
  - Our fork is based on Google's open source Cloud Storage FUSE 
  ([`gcsfuse@3525748`](https://github.com/etclab/gcsfuse/commit/3525748)) 
  - Implements Akesoâ€™s strategies on top of `gcsfuse` to transparently encrypt 
  and decrypt objects during read and write operations.
- **art** - [Link](https://github.com/etclab/art)
  - Implements the Asynchronous Ratcheting Tree (ART) data structure and 
  associated protocols
- **nestedaes** - [Link](https://github.com/etclab/nestedaes)
  - Implements the updatable re-encryption using nested AES
- **akesod** - [Link](./akesod/)
  - Manages group membership, and generates the re-encryption tokens
- **akeso-evals** - [Link](https://github.com/etclab/akeso-evals)
  - Includes various utility scripts for parsing data, plotting figures, 
  running pre-evaluation, etc. 

- **Build Environment**
  - We developed and tested Akeso and its components on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, but it should work correctly on other systems as long as the required packages are installed. 
  - All components listed above can be run with the following dependencies: `go, gnuplot, fuse3, and python3`. 
  - The required packages can be installed using the command below: 
    ```bash
    ./common/install-dependencies.sh && ./common/install-go.sh
    ```

## Reproducing Experiments

### Figure 2: Key update operation using ART vs pairwise Double Ratchet key transport
- Requirements: `bash`, `python3` and `gnuplot`
- Folder: `figure2`
- Run benchmark: `./fig2.sh bench`
- Plot results: `./fig2.sh plot`
- Update submodules: `git submodule update --init --remote --recursive`

### Figure 7: Latency to read/write an entire object using encrypted cloud storage
- Requirements: 
    - publicly accessible cloud storage bucket
    - or a restricted service account that users can use to access the buckets
    - for now the service account only has read/write access to a few buckets
- Folder: `figure7` (TODO: write a line about what Figure 7 measures or shows)
- Run benchmark: `./fig7.sh bench`
- Plot results: `./fig7.sh plot`

### Figure 9: Time to re-encrypt a bucket of varying sizes and Figure 10: Time to re-encrypt a 1G bucket, varying object sizes in the bucket
- Requirements:
  - VM to host the `akesod` orchestrator; this can be confidential cloud VM or a trusted local server VM
- Folder: `figure9-10`
- Setup benchmark:`./fig9-10.sh setup`
- Run benchmark:`./fig9-10.sh bench`
- Plot results:`./fig9-10.sh plot`

### Appendix
- TODO: where you describe in detail all the permissions required to setup and run your experiments
- TODO: discuss about the different variants of gcsfuse? maybe in the gcsfuse repo itself?
