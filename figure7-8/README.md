- things I need
    - Done - task0 - first make sure you can run the fig7 evaluations from local machine for cmek
    - Done - task2 - ensure the scripts for parsing the data, and re-creating the figure7 works 
        - Done - assume there's always 1 run
        - Done - the hardcoded data for cmek runs
    - Done - task1 - ensure git commits are applied correctly and in all the relevant branches
    - Done - task3 - make sure you can run the Akeso variant
    - Done - task4 - make sure you can run all other variants 
    - Done - taks4 - make sure you can extract the data for fig8 and generate the figure/plot
    - Done - how to handle git submodules in the figure7 folder? - same repo multiple branches
    - Done - keep reusing the same bucket, keyrings and everything else
    - ensure there's a script to install go, fuse, gcloud
    - document our version of gcsfuse library in a readme.md file
        - dependencies and tools required if any
        - how to build and run the software
        - how to run tests/experiments
    - separate vm for evaluation 
    - Done - recreate the figures with new script - writes weren't trimmed properly

    - Done - a service account 
        - Done - that can access the buckets
        - Done - not required - maybe it needs access to the keyring and keys as well
        - Skip - finally if everything works maybe allow sa to create vm and run experiments from the vm
        - Done - `gsutil` works fine but using `gcsfuse` allows access to all the buckets
    - Done - make sure `gcloud auth application-default login` is run and you can access cloud buckets
    - Done - maybe service account would enable this too? Yes
